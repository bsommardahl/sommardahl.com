Back-end devs make sure entire systems tie\n            together properly, data is secure, data is available to the\n            front-end, etc. You'll never see anything a back-end developer does\n            because their work is all behind the scenes.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> has skill and experience in\n            both the front-end and the back-end. Full-Stack devs often know\n            multiple programming languages and can handle any situation no\n            matter the layer. Full-stack devs are very valuable because of their\n            versatility.\n          </p>\n        </QAndA>\n\n        <QAndA\n          id=\"faq-finish-on-time\"\n          question=\"What if I don't complete the curriculum before my end date?\"\n        >\n          <p>\n            If this is on your mind, then you must really understand how a\n            self-paced curriculum works! In a mastery-based program like we have\n            in Sommardahl Academy, learning is naturally self-paced. While we\n            wholeheartedly believe this is the BEST way to learn to code,\n            self-paced programs also come with some natural pitfall or risks.\n            One such risk is the possibility of getting behind and running out\n            of time. This is a reality we help students work through on a daily\n            basis. Here are a few of our typical strategies:\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Weekly Trajectory Evaluations: </b> They say, \"An ounce of\n            prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" We agree! Rather than waiting\n            until it's too late to correct your course, we prefer a more\n            granular approach. Each week, we look at the data for each student\n            and calculate their new trajectory based on past progress. If any\n            student is falling behind, we meet with them to strategize and plan\n            a way back.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Time Extensions: </b> Sometimes it's better to plan on some extra\n            time in our program rather than trying to cram in too much in a\n            short amount of time... it all depends on what your brain needs! We\n            have various options to extend your time in the program so that you\n            can take the time you truly need to gain real mastery.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Target Resets: </b> There may be scenarios where it is\n            appropriate to adjust your target level so that you can finish on\n            time with less pressure. Unlike universities or traditional programs\n            where \"graduation\" is the only meaningful achievement, Sommardahl\n            Academy provides numerous independently-valuable milestones called\n            \"certifications\". We have nine such certifications, each\n            representing valuable and marketable sets of skills. Perhaps you\n            originally set a goal of achieving level 6 (Full-Stack Developer),\n            but find yourself running out of time. At that point in time, it\n            might be improbable that you could achieve level 6, but more\n            possible to achieve level 4 or 5 (still very respectable levels!).\n            Resetting your target level can help relieve some pressure and\n            ensure a stronger finish!\n          </p>\n        </QAndA>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport QAndA from \"@/components/QAndA\";\nimport Unsplash from \"@/components/Unsplash\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    QAndA,\n    Unsplash,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<style></style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./QandASection.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./QandASection.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./QandASection.vue?vue&type=template&id=8ce18124&\"\nimport script from \"./QandASection.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./QandASection.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","<template>\n  <div class=\"container pt-4\">\n    <QandASection />\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport Technologies from \"@/components/Technologies\";\nimport QandASection from \"@/components/sections/QandASection\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    Technologies,\n    QandASection,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped></style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=template&id=a03d780a&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./FAQs.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"a03d780a\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container\"},[_vm._m(0),_c('ol',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb\"},[_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item\"},[_c('router-link',{attrs:{\"to\":\"/\"}},[_vm._v(\"Home\")])],1),_c('li',{staticClass:\"breadcrumb-item active\"},[_vm._v(\"Blog Home 2\")])]),_vm._m(1),_vm._m(2),_vm._m(3),_vm._m(4),_vm._m(5)])}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('h1',{staticClass:\"mt-4 mb-3\"},[_vm._v(\" Blog Home Two \"),_c('small',[_vm._v(\"Subheading\")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"card mb-4\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"card-body\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":\"#\"}},[_c('img',{staticClass:\"img-fluid rounded\",attrs:{\"src\":\"http://placehold.it/750x300\",\"alt\":\"\"}})])]),_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-lg-6\"},[_c('h2',{staticClass:\"card-title\"},[_vm._v(\"Post Title\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"card-text\"},[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

That information includes\n      the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type\n      and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at,\n      while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such\n      information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible\n      for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service\n      provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of\n      connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website\n      to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By\n      identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design\n      the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and\n      ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the\n      Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the\n      aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the\n      Website.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Web Cookies A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a\n      unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that\n      the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a\n      query to the website.

We will not send any of your account\n      information to the connected social networking site without first\n      disclosing that to you. Each social network may further allow you to set\n      privacy controls around your information on their system, and our\n      collection of information will always follow such controls and\n      permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement\n      by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the\n      available features and shared information are subject to change without\n      notice to you. We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect\n      you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when\n      you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s\n      “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin\n      will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that\n      provider’s servers.

So for\n      example, when you click on the Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website,\n      Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen\n      resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access\n      the Website.
