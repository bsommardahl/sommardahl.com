      <p class="mb-5 text-center">
        Sommardahl Academy offers the following loan terms to help those who
        need smaller payments and to spread their tuition out over time. This
        loan is offered at 0% interest for the life of the loan. If you choose
        this option, we ask that you pay the first payment of $500 up front.
        Afterwards, an admissions counselor will reach out with more specific
        loan terms.
