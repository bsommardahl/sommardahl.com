        Sommardahl Academy has partnered with Meritize to provide our students
        with financing options to fund your education. With a Meritize Loan, you
        can get credit for your merit and potentially improve your loan options
        by sharing your academic history, military background, or work
        experience. If approved, full deferment during school is available.
